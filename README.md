## Structural & Property Upscaling for Reservoir Simulation

## Tools Used
- Petrel (by Schlumberger)
- Eclipse (by Schlumberger)
  
## Skills Applied: 
-Grid resolution optimization
-Properties (Porosity, permeability, ect) upscaling
-Reservoir simulation 
-Production analysis

## Project Description:
This project involved transitioning from a coarse grid to a fine grid model to enhance the accuracy of reservoir simulation. Structural upscaling was performed in Petrel to refine the grid resolution while maintaining geological integrity. Property upscaling followed, with particular attention to porosity and permeability distributions, ensuring consistency with well log data and geological models.

The refined and upscaled models were exported to Eclipse for dynamic simulation. Various production scenarios were tested to assess the impact of upscaling on reservoir behavior, forecast future performance, and validate the integrity of the upscaled models.

## Key Outcomes:

-Improved simulation accuracy by incorporating high-resolution structural details.
-Quantified the impact of property upscaling on production rates and reservoir performance.
-Demonstrated the importance of scale-appropriate property averaging methods.
